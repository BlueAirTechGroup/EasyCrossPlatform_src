Require Support: Unix / Windows System | C++ 11
## Develop Theory
Everybody Loves C++, but there is actually no user-friendly libs for beginners to start using C++ with full support of network and multithreading function, while covering the hardware and underlying technologies. <br />
Influenced by <a href="http://reasoning.biz" target="_blank">Reasoning</a> Library, however, that library is no longer maintained since 2008<br />
With less code, developers can develop more safe code preventing memory leaks and debug less. EasyCrossPlatform also brings noticeable performance while enabling developers to develop codes fast and secure.<br />
## Build
This project is not even released with beta and it is still in its early stage of development.<br />
If you cannot wait to see it, simply run xmake in the directory to generate a static link library that you can use.<br />
Remeber that the lib file generated is not cross-platform betweeen Win and Linux, and between different versions of Linux.<br />
You need to generate lib file each time when you are switching platforms.
