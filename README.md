Source Code for EasyCrossPlatform, only for development purpose.
## Introduction
A easy-to-use cross-platform C++ library designed for PHP and Python Users.<br />
Powered by Windy, a member of <a href="http://www.xsyds.cn/" target="_blank">BlueAirTechGroup</a><br />
Libs: MultiThreadPool | MultiThread | FileIO | TCP & UDP Sockets | <strike>HTTP(s)_Requests</strike> | <strike>GUI</strike><br />
Test Env: Windows 10 + Visual Studio 2017 | Ubuntu LTS16.04LTS + g++<br />
Require Support: Unix / Windows System | C++ 11
## Develop Theory
Everybody Loves C++, but there is actually no user-friendly libs for beginners to start using C++ with full support of network and multithreading function, while covering the hardware and underlying technologies. <br />
Influenced by <a href="http://reasoning.biz" target="_blank">Reasoning</a> Library, however, that library is no longer maintained since 2008<br />
With less code, developers can develop more safe code preventing memory leaks and debug less. EasyCrossPlatform also brings noticeable performance while enabling developers to develop codes fast and secure.<br />
## Build
This project is not even released with beta and it is still in its early stage of development. We are planning to build it with xmake, to generate static libraries that you can link.
Currently, you can simply run xmake, to make the static library in the directory to get the static link library.
